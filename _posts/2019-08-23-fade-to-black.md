title: Fade To Black
---

Sitting, sitting, sitting. Waiting. Waiting for this moment to pass. This too shall pass. The good with the bad.

I don't know how to write fiction. The best I can do is abstraction. The best I can do is to tell a true story obliquely. Mostly we prefer to only glance at the truth through a foggy window, so we don't have to face its full darkness. Or its full brightness.

The truth itself is a kind of black and white. A kind of absolute. It's our lack of understanding, or our lack of attention, or our lack of faith, that creates the grey cloud of uncertainty around the truth. Looking directly at the truth does not set us free. It blinds us. In the singular moment of eye contact, you witness the truth's blinding light. In the next moment there is only darkness. From white light to black pitch in an instant. And every moment after, you persist in truth's bright abyss. Unable to see anything else. Unable to glance away.

Alone in the crowd of truth seekers you shout, *I have seen the light and I am blinded by it! Do not ask me for directions. Do not ask me which way to look. I see nothing but truth's cruel void!* They look to your face, to your retinas burned to ash. They reconsider the truth they seek. As they should. There is no companionship in this dark place.

Alone and forgotten, you stumble through the world you once knew. Calling on memories to guide you. Searching now for something, anything, to hold on to. But all those memories are fading fast, their colors bleached by truth's light. All that's left now is to sit and wait for the end. Does it fade to black? Or does it fade to white?
