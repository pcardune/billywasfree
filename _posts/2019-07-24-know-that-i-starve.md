The purpose of love is to reflect your experience and mirror your reality. It is a confirmation of your experiential existence, when you ask yourself:

“Is this real?”

Her face looks back at me and her eyes speak the truth to me more than a pinch in a dream. To share in experience is to have a unified mutual existence with the clarity of the mirror. I don’t have to think about what I feel because I see my feeling inside out, reflected in the glint of her eyes.

“I see myself in you.”

Who is becoming who? I grasp for her emotion and make it my own.

“I feel only in as much as you do.”

Without you, my feelings are blind and lost and out of balance with no reciprocating image to pull them into the real, into the now, into the this. This substance. This ether. This space. Without you there is no mirror for my identity. Then my identity is lost.

But maybe I am the mirror, taking on the identity of whoever dares to look at me. But with no one, I have no color or shape, no feeling or emotion, no existence to explore or experience. I lie restless in the ether wanting to grab the substance of your life as you look away from me, starving me of what is not mine, but yours.

“Take your identity from me, but know that I starve.”
