title: No One Is Safe
---

I hate these places. The acoustics. The lighting. The endless cackling. The music too low to make a difference. The coffee tepid and bitter. It is this horror that I surround myself with. People come here together so they can shout without hearing each other. So they can be together while being apart. Dressed up just so. And deep behind their eyes they are all suffering.

Does it echo in here when the place is empty? Or only when it is full? My ears are burning with their piercing screams. And they would claim there is no violence here. They would claim there is no suffering. All while they stand in front of this monument to violence and suffering that they themselves have constructed.

How many seconds pass as we sit here caught in this vortex of inattention? Our souls stuttering a halted speech. We can not speak. We can not breath. Gulping for air as we drown in our own poisoned tomb. We bury ourselves alive. And wonder why we can't fly. We'd rather choke on our own vomit than speak the truth of our life. And still we claim there is no violence here.

When I tell people about this violence, they think I've been hurt by it. They think I am upset about it. They think it must be a problem for me. They think there is something to fix. But that is a great misunderstanding. How else could I find such peace, but by surrounding myself with this violence? With my eyes wide open. Alert to each painful blow. Finally paying attention in a way I never have before. In a way they can not understand. In a way that terrifies them. If I can see through the veil they have so carefully crafted, if I can be witness to these truths, then what other knowledge might I bring to bare? What other truths will I share? No one is safe from my piercing vision.
