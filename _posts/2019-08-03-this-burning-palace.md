I am trapped in this burning palace of awareness. Flames all around me. Consuming me. Turning me to ash and scattering my body like dust in the wind. Hot like a furnace with a door welded shut. Sweat boiling away into a scalding gas. Where was I before I melted into nothing? Where am I now? What am I now?

They close their door on me. Turn their backs to me. And try to forget that I am here. But each time they turn around and open the door, there I stand. And there I will always be, waiting in my torment, a deathly pale expression on my face, waiting for them to accept me into their hearts. Waiting for them to realize that the door is an illusion. That nothing stands between us. That the furnace of creation, of existence, is all around us, consuming us through the suffering of our lives. We are just star dust burning in the palace of god.

My heart aches for them. Each moment of inattention like the tip of a sharp knife entering my chest to pierce the outer membrane of my blood soaked heart. I bleed an endless river of pain for their shut minds, shut mouths, shut thoughts, shut feelings, shut ears. They think, but see not the source of their words. They feel, but see not the reasons why. They listen, but hear nothing. All the while, my blood flows into the well of my endless love for them. Where it waits for the few who will dig through their endless pain. Who will dig deep under the crust of existence, and find me. Find my endless love.
