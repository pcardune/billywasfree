I’m not sure how much longer I have left to live. Think about this for a moment.

How have you reacted after reading these words? What thoughts came up in an instant? You react as though something terrible has happened. You judge the meaning of these words in an instant. And the judgement is _bad_. _“Not good. This is not good. Why are you saying this? What is wrong? What has happened? Why do you feel you are about to die?”_ But you misunderstand.

I am not stating this as a reaction to some kind of unexpected occurrence. This is not a reflection on some recent ailment. This is a statement about the truth of existence. I don’t feel this way _because of_ something else. I am simply sharing my awareness of a universal truth. I am simply pointing out that the sky is blue, the water is cold, and one day I will die.

Tell me, how much longer do you have left to live? Are you sure of this? The best you can say is, _“well, I will probably be alive tomorrow, and I will probably be alive next week, and I will probably be alive next year.”_ Deep down you know there is no certainty to your life. That is why you used the word _probably_. So why then did you have such a reaction to the words above? Why the instantaneous judgement?

You have been stuck in your body for your entire life. And along with your body, you have been stuck inside the illusion that you will live forever. And as such, you have never truly confronted the truth of existence. You have never truly confronted the truth of your own death. And when given the opportunity to do just that, to look into the abyss with eyes wide open, you shy away. Because you are terrified. Terrified of the idea that one day you will die. Terrified by the idea that that day may be today. Why are you so terrified of death?

Attachment. Attached to your body. Attached to the illusion of immortality. You have grown attached to many things during your life. Attached to your relationships. Attached to your family. Attached to your career. Attached to your identity. Attached to your ego. Attached to your self. And I say these words without judgement. This is how life is. This is how life is supposed to be. Of course you are attached. Of course you are terrified by the thought of losing all these things you’ve grown so attached to. Of course you are terrified by the thought of your own death. How else would you experience the universal truth that life is suffering?

And so when I say I’m not sure how much longer I have left to live, of course you imagine that I too am terrified by this thought. That surely I must be reacting to the unavoidable loss of my most cherished attachments. That surely something is wrong. That surely I am experiencing distress. But you misunderstand.

For I have looked into the abyss with eyes wide open. I have seen the truth of existence. I have seen past the illusion of immortality. And I have faced the death of my body. And so now I say I’m not sure how much longer I have left to live and it feels as though I am stating the obvious. Of course the sky is blue, the water is cold, and one day I will die. How could it be otherwise?

I write to tell you that the abyss is filled with light. I write to tell you that beyond the terror there is only peace. I write to tell you that beyond the death of our bodies, there is life. And when I say I’m not sure how much longer I have left to live, I am expressing the greatest joy that I have ever experienced. The greatest beauty in the universe. The greatest feeling of well being that I have ever had. Because now I understand the meaning of life. Now I understand my purpose. The meaning of life is suffering, and my purpose is to pay attention. To look into the abyss with eyes wide open, and see the light.
