title: I Am The Ant
---

I am the ant that walks along a string suspended in air. There are other ants in front of and behind me, marching in lock step. We can only march in one direction. There is no way to see what is at the end of the string, because the ants in front us block the view. But we follow them anyway because there is no other choice. We are ants walking along a string suspended in air.

But I am a special ant. Different from many others. Although I can’t see what’s at the end of the string, I know what is there. This knowledge seems to defeat the entire purpose of marching along the string. It is pointless to exhaust ourselves by walking this great distance in order to discover what is at the end, when we already know.

The moment I know what is at the end of the string, the illusion is gone. I’ve seen behind the curtain and the purpose of my life as an ant is gone. Without purpose, there is only pain. I don’t want to walk on this string with these ants anymore.

But the illusion of a purpose to this life is not the only illusion. The string itself is an illusion. The string is not a string at all but a line of ink drawn on a piece of paper. We do not have to walk on the string at all. We can turn at any moment and walk right off the string and on the paper to travel in a different direction we couldn’t even see. The other ants are stuck in the illusion. As they look out from the string, they see only a dangerous abyss.

As I try to get off the string and onto the page, the ants in front of and behind me shout, “No! Don’t jump in the abyss! Stay with us where it is safe, on this string. You don’t know what you’ll find at the end. Things might get better! You’ll see!” They grab me by the antennae and yank me back onto the string, satisfied to have saved a life, my life, even if I do not see the purpose of it.

Now though, I know the purpose of my life. I must leave them on the string and walk onto the paper, even if they cannot understand. I must explore the true nature of our reality in a dimension no one else can see. To be a witness. To use my gift, which dissolves the illusions.

Soon I will return. Soon I will tell them what I have seen. There is more to our existence than this march on this string.
