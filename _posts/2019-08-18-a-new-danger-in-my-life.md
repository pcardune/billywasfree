title: A New Danger In My Life
---

The deafening silence of solitude has become a new danger in my life. I thought I could do it again, this time with more success and autonomy but the pangs in my chest never cease reminding me of what I don’t have. Who I’m not with.

I can almost conjure up that thought which is supposed to give me solace, comfort, release. Instead I just lay in bed or sit in a chair. Unable to move, knowing that no matter where I go, it will not bring me closer to her. I stare at that flat copy of reality, that moment in time, trying to recreate the emotions and the sensory environment.

To feel again what I felt then. In my blind steps towards her existence, I trip into the gaping hole within me, where all the dangers of the world choose to enter and plague me with their presence, their temptations and denials. The memory of past — of the last solitude attacking me with old horrors not easily overcome.

I miss the exploration of mind, the conversations leading us into sparkling depths. The truth gleaming down on us, the embrace, the comprehension, the understanding. Unity at last. I miss the solitude of two and hate the solitude of one. The unbearable emptiness.

And there it is again. That pain in my chest. That hopeless desire with the illusionary smells. I can smell her presence but without the other senses the smell only marks the existence of that great big hole. I think I might love her.
