Life is liquid. It is a flowing, changing stream of belief, idea, concept, character, personality, identity, self, and soul. It is wrong to guide a stream too strongly. Turbulence can be reduced, but the path will never change.

Accept the changes and flow that is the stream of life. Embrace it. Experience the flow. Donâ€™t work against it. Feel every slight twist and turn. Know the change. See it, accept it, and let it take you to new places, and new identities.

Experience all the identities and see the greatness of each. Feel and remember all the feelings, good and bad. The hate, the uncertainty, the vulgarity, the awkwardness. Experience these and learn to love these. These are who you are.

But when the stream changes and takes you to a new identity, love that identity too. This is life. It is a ride. Remember that you can end it at any time. Just know that the stream changes always, and with patience you will move through the sour sections.

Life is worth experiencing even if it is sour. Understand the sourness. Taste it. This is the purpose of life.
