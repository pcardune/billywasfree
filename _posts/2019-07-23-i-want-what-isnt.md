title: I Want What Isn't

I need to feel something. I put myself through certain motions in an attempt to reach out and grab a feeling. I want to discover something. I want to think and know and experience a different world and see everything differently. I need to experience something boundless and supernatural. I want to notice everything all at once. I want to experience everything at the same time. I want to be everything and be conscious of everything. I want to feel this pen writing on this page and I want to be the page as the pen marks it. I want to burn in the all consuming fire of extravagance. I want the wealth that is everything. Not to have it but to be it. I want to have a consciousness for every discrete part of reality. Atoms, quarks, black holes, planets, culture, people, animals. Everything from the microscopic to the macroscopic. I want to feel everything in its singularity and its lack of singularness. I want to be separate and whole. I want what isn’t. I need it but cannot reach it. I want to fully exist in every sense that is possible. And it takes something to figure all this out. It takes a certain mood. A certain mental makeup that only lasts for minutes at a time. Only to be destroyed, it is so fragile. I want to hang on to it. And now it is lost. I don’t even remember what it was I wanted. It’s cold. I’m not ready to go. I don’t want to leave.
