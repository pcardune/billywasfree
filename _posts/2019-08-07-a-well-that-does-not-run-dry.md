My love is a well that does not run dry. There is no emptying of my love. There is no losing my love. You can only turn away from it, and even then you still have it. There is no gate you must walk through to have my love. There is no thief that could steal my love. The well is deep and ever present. It is pure. Untarnished. Like gold. There is no poisoning of this well that is my love. From it, your flowers are nourished. Your buds blossom. Your fruit grows heavy with juice. There is no end to my love. And you may drink from it to your heart's content.

Others will dig their own wells in search of my love. And they will find my love just as you have found my love. Because my love extends to all places. It permeates the recesses of the earth, flowing through endless caverns deep under the crust. And there my love awaits all those who thirst in the desert of existence. Do not be afraid when others find my love. My love is not yours to have nor mine to give. My love knows no bounds.

When you see others digging, tell them of the nature of my love. Tell them of the well that does not run dry. Wipe away the dust on their tired faces with your tears, and invite them to the well that you have dug. For all who come shall be replenished. All who thirst shall have their thirst quenched. Just as they cannot steal this love away, so you cannot keep it from them. My love is not yours to have nor mine to give. It is here, ever present. My love is a well that does not run dry.
