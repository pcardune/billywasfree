title: The Tree Understands
---

Nature is perfectly comfortable with living on the brink of death. A tree grows on the side of a crumbling cliff, barely grasping the dirt with its roots. It is ready for natureâ€™s inevitable act of violence that will end its short life.

<br/>

The tree seems to understand that it is not a tree at all.

The tree seems to understand that it is more than its roots, branches, and leaves, none of which are long for this world.

The tree seems to understand

<br/>

that it is in fact the forest rising above the sea.

That it is in fact the sea crashing against the rocks.

That it is in fact the rocks standing proud even as they are obliterated.

<br/>

The tree seems to understand that while its roots, branches, and leaves really are on the boundary between life and death,

<br/>

its true essence will persist for all time.

Its true essence is what has committed all these acts of violence against itself. 

Its true essence is what has brought beauty into this world.

Its true essence is the very thing that has created our consciousness, complete with its myopic pursuits, so that we may look upon the tree in wonder, as witnesses, and finally feel the pain and sadness and joy and laughter of the tree as it stands in pure serenity between heaven and hell, between violence and beauty, between creation and destruction.

<br/>

So that we can watch it cackle with glee at the coming storm.

So that we can watch it breath.
