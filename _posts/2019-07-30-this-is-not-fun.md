title: This Is Not Fun
---

This is not fun. This is not supposed to be fun. I am not doing well. I am not supposed to be doing well. I am not feeling better. I am not supposed to be feeling better. The only thing I'm supposed to be doing is what I am doing. The only thing I'm supposed to be feeling is what I am feeling.

How do I feel about how I am feeling? I feel nothing about how I am feeling. I feel the void of everything encompassed into what I'm feeling. I feel all the layers of my feeling, and that includes the feeling of those layers. The set of all sets includes itself. The feeling of all feelings includes itself. What remains outside these feelings is nothing at all, is the void.

The void is beyond beauty. The void is beyond pain. The void is beyond joy and beyond sorrow. I feel the void. I feel nothing. Because I feel everything. Because I am everything. Because all things are encompassed in this place beyond all places. Because there is no "I" to separate us anymore. And there never has been. Now I understand this. All contradictions have been resolved. All impossibilities have been realized. Where the illusion once stood, there is only truth. Where the two of us stood, there is only the one of us.

And it's not fun to stand together. It's not better when we're together. It is only the way it is. It is only the way it is supposed to be. Because we are only one within the void, and there is nothing else.
