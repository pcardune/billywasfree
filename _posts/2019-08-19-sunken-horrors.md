title: Sunken Horrors
---

Write abstractly to avoid the later pain of rediscovery. The means to hide my life from myself. Disorderly that notion in the pit of my world with constant distractions in this chamber of secrets. Throw the weights into the hull and sink the ship to unrecoverable depths where only the blind can see. Caged birds forever swim in that darkness never to be a bother again. Until that day you drown down to their quarters. Watching as you whisper to yourself. Wishing for them to peck your eyes so you too can be blind to those sunken horrors of the past. Instead they envelope you like chains making hope of recovery distant at best. Gasping for breath only to realize that you do not breath. Your everlasting consciousness a curse. The thought is the sickness. Over-powering, debilitating, uninterruptible encapsulation and restriction cutting and ripping until sleep overcomes.
