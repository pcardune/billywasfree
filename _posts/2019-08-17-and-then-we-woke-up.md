title: And Then We Woke Up
---

In January 2019, I had a dream. We were trapped in a holding cell in the desert. There were many of us there, looking out through the iron bars of the gate that held us captive. Outside, the wind blew and kicked the dust up. We were men and women, old and young, with children among us. Our faces were dirty with sand and grit, congealed by the dried sweat that came pouring out with the heat, and our tears. We had been here for a long while, our captors just beyond our grasp. And we felt a great sense of distress. We felt trapped in this cage.

*Let us out!*

*Why are you keeping us in here?*

*What have we done to deserve this?*

I walked up to an old man, his face wrinkled, his hair white and unkempt, fear in his eyes. I looked into his soul and out of compassion told him what I saw:

*You are not in here.*

In the next instant, I became the old man I was speaking to. I saw myself look into my soul and I heard myself say what I saw:

*You are not in here.*

And I understood. My body disappeared. The bodies of all the other people disappeared. Our captors disappeared. The iron bars disappeared. The desert disappeared, along with the wind and the dust and the distress we felt at our situation. We understood.

Who could capture us, but our own selves? What cage could hold us, but our own misunderstanding? How could we, who are boundless, be held captive but by our own dream? We dreamed a dream so real that we believed it to be wakefulness.

And then we woke up.
