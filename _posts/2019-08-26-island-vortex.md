title: Island Vortex
---

Island vortex drawing people to some kind of escape from a false reality. Trying to escape into a truth. A truth found inside of a deprivation. Inside of an enclosure. A hall of mirrors. To discover the crude imperfections of self. We must deprive ourselves of distractions. Find ourselves within some kind of solitude. A solitude even among others. A solitude within a crowded arena of seekers all looking for something they haven’t ever seen before.

We try to find it through exposure. Exposing something inside too the outside world so it can reflect back on us and reveal the path to a transcending escape where we will find comfort and solace in our awkward show.

Some kind of connection. Connection to each other. Connection to the space between us. Connection to the situation we find ourselves in. A shared situation that we can’t help but drown in. But here we drown together as one. We find the solitude of the crowd melted from individual particles of star dust inside the furnace of creation. Melted into liquid stuff that oozes out into existence. Flowing outwards. Filling the space between atoms. A lattice of universal connectivity.

But I’m not sure everyone sees this. I’m not sure anyone realizes that they already have what they came looking for. That they are already part of the primordial soup. Inextricably linked to each other. There’s no need for the rest of this. We’re already found. We just need to pay attention.
