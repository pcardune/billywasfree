title: This Violence
---

Do you feel this violence? Our collective inability to pay attention to our reality is a great act of violence that the universe commits against itself. All around us are the signs of this timeless enduring violence which we continually ignore to our detriment. I feel it in my bones. I feel the violence and I feel the violence of not knowing.

All you have to do is look. Sit still. Pay attention to the violence of this moment. The eruption of all creation. Which has never stopped since time began. Here it is all around us, continuing to unfold in it’s chaos. The violence of the sun beating down on us. The violence of time escaping our grasp. The violence of our eyes as we search for meaning in each other’s words. The violence of our love unmet. The violence of our expectation. The violence of our suffering.

But you can not pass judgment on all this violence. It is a necessary violence. It is the violence of our own creation. A violence of our own making. There is no putting it away. No putting it to bed. No soothing of the wounds that it makes. To end the violence is to end all of existence. And surely that is not within our purview. Because here we are. Living our lives of violence. Whether we know it or not. Whether we pay attention or not.

The lake is still cold.
