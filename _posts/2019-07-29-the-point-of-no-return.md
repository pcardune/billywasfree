title: The Point of No Return
---

Describe this point. It’s not a line. It’s not a circle. It’s a single point. Even that is giving it too much credit. But let’s call it the point of no return. Really its the void. The space with no points. It is the point of no return, turned inwards on itself. Surely there is no return from that. Surely that is what we call the void.

And when you ask “where is this point?” I say this point is right here. And when you ask “how far are we from this point?” I say not far at all. Because here it is. Perhaps you’d like to escape from this point. But this is the point of no return. Turned inwards. There is no escape. And when you ask, “how did we come to this point?” I say we’ve always been here. Because it’s not really a point that you come to. It’s really a void. There is no coming or going. To it or from it. It is the point of no return. Turned inwards.

The whole of the universe is but a void. Its expanse is an illusion. An elaborate one, but an illusion none-the-less. In truth there is only a void. This point turned inwards on itself, this void, is the opposite of a point of light that casts its rays outwards. There is no light to emit. And without light, there is no darkness. And without darkness, there are no shadows. And without shadows, there is no hiding. I think that must be why people are so terrified of the void. They have no place to hide.
