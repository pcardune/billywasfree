title: The River of Darkness
---

We are all walking down the river of darkness. Searching for the light at the end of an endless tunnel. With each step we feel the cold water permeating our woolen socks. Sopping wet, there is no dry land to rest our toes. Our toe nails falling off. Our skin swollen and soft. A softness without solace. Cold, cold, cold this river.

Searching, we walked, until we came to a lake. A lake the size of an ocean. Too deep to walk, the water came up to our necks and we gave ourselves over to the abyss. We swam without saving any energy to get back to the shallow river, hoping to traverse the lake. We swam until our arms grew tired, and our fingers numb. We swam util we could swim no more. Coming to the end of our effort, we gave up and floated a while.

Soon a storm came with winds and waves. We floated, gasping for breath between the troughs that threatened to swallow us up. The howling wind piercing our ear drums as the waves crashed over our heads. Lightning cracked in the dark sky above, disemboweling the air with a clap of thunder. Telling us what was soon to come.

The storm grew and grew. Engulfing the entirety of our awareness. The waves so big, like mountains surrounding an inland sea, the earth itself turning to liquid and closing in around us on all sides. With no place to go, no place to find solace, we were consumed by the universe. Eaten, we sank into its gullet, drowning. The water entering into our lungs with a force that ruptured our insides and tore our bones from their sockets. We waited for our death, for the end of our suffering. Waited to be snuffed out.

But our death never came. Our bodies crushed to a fine powder that sunk further into the abyss, we persisted. We persisted into the very void that had consumed us. We persisted in a way we could not have understood while we walked and swam, searching for light. Our bodies were but a dream, held onto with an effort that only a storm could break. Held onto with an effort that only death could end. With the storm raging and our bodies destroyed, we woke up from our dream. We woke up to ourselves and saw only light. Saw only the truth of our existence. We were the river. We were the lake. We were the storm and its waves. We dreamt so that we could wake. We finally understood the cold of the cold lake.
