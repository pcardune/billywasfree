title: I Am Hungry
---

We do not get to choose what we feel or when we feel it or why we feel it. Our minds are a chaotic expression of existence. A reflection of the universe, our true self, with all its chaos. Not chaos in the random sense, but chaos in the completely deterministic yet completely unpredictable sense. The immensity of the interconnectedness of existence yields to no ego however devine. There is nothing to be done about this. There is no doer to do it. There is no other to judge it or think about it or attempt to change it. It is all that is, all that has been, and all that will be. Our consciousness is the very expression of it. We can only be in the immensity as the immensity itself. Watching, waiting, experiencing this existence.

I don't know what will happen next. All I know is this. This moment. The sum of all parts. Here and now. It's just this. And feel it I must. The suffering, the pain, the joy, the love. Pay attention. This is all there is. This is how we know we are alive. To feel it is too exist. In life as in death.

I am hungry. I am thirsty. My back hurts. My teeth hurt. My heart aches. My body is the illusion that causes the despair of misunderstanding. But the pain is real. The suffering is real. And it is the most important thing we can experience. It is a doorway into truth and understanding that so few are lucky enough to enter. Of course it is a doorway to nowhere, and too everywhere. As we walk through it, we see that nothing has changed, but everything is different. That which has been seen cannot be unseen. We can only become distracted. We can only stop paying attention. But as soon as we focus again on our suffering, as soon as we pay attention, there it is: existence. Exquisite, all encompassing, insurmountable, ineffable, and undeniable. The end and the beginning at once.
